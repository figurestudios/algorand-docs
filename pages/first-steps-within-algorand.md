# First steps within Algorand ($ALGO)

So... You have now heard about Algorand, but you have not quite figured out what it is. Then, this post will hopefully be a good primer to get you started within the technology, tokenomics, and some examples of what it can be used for. 

## Use a wallet
First off, you are going to need to get a wallet. Here are the most common ones
* [The Official Wallet](https://algorandwallet.com/) - works on both PCs and mobile devices!
* [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/algorand-wallet) - keep your $ALGO on a hardware-based wallet.
* [MyALGO](https://wallet.myalgo.com/) - a non-official web-wallet.
<sub>There are also more wallets which support it [here](https://algorand.foundation/the-algo/the-algo-ecosystem).</sub>

## Rewards / How to get $ALGO
Now when you have your wallet, you probably want to fill it up in some sort of way. Here are a few methods
* [Exchanges](#buy-through-exchanges) - Buy an exchange.
* [Official Wallet](https://algorandwallet.com/) - Hold $ALGO - earn rewards. It's really that simple.
* [Bounties](https://gitcoin.co/algorandfoundation/bounties) - If you feel like you can handle it - compete for some bounties!

## Buy through exchanges
If you have the money and don't want to spend time on bounties, care about taxes, and simply get coins and get coins fast then you can do so in the following exchanges
* [Binance](https://binance.com)
* [OKEx](https://www.okex.com/)
* [Coinbase Pro](https://pro.coinbase.com/)
<sub>There are also some more exchanges listed [here](https://cryptorank.io/price/algorand/exchanges).</sub>

## Use-cases
### Yieldly
[Yieldly](https://yieldly.finance/) is a DeFi (Decentralized Finance) collection on Algorand. It currently allows for [No-Loss Lotteries](https://yieldly.finance/no-loss-lottery-staging/), [Asset Staking](https://yieldly.finance/asset-staking/), & [Cross-Chain Exchanges](https://yieldly.finance/bridges/). On the main page, you can also see more products currently being worked on.
### Payment Systems
In 2020, Caff√© Barbera [announced](https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2020/09/16/caffe-barbera-italy-accepts-cryptocurrencies/) that they would be accepting cryptocurrencies as payments. $ALGO was one of these coins.

[Bleumi Pay](https://bleumi.com/pay/) is another great example of how Algorand can be used for payments - as $ALGO is one of the few supported coins on their platform.

## Understanding the Governance
In the governance system, there are three key elements; recruiting and rewarding governors, voting, and execution.

The recruiting and rewarding governor's part basically means that if you hold $ALGO, vote on all proposals, and not lost the $ALGO committed during a three-month period.

The voting process is just that you, as an $ALGO-holder, can vote on various proposals assuming you meet some criteria which I took up in the previous point.

The execution part is simply that the Foundation must finalize and execute the tasks depending on how the votes went.
